# Conditional form to make inventory of accessibility needs
We decided to call our form "Personal Event Configurator". We recommend that you place the link to this in a prominent spot on your pages, and describe it in such a way that the visitor understands this can be used before ordering a ticket.
## Goal of this form
The form is based on the principle **"Nothing for us, without us"**. The goal is for both attendees and organizers to get a clear inventory of what accessibility / inclusivity needs are required and met. Users will not only be invited to respond to things we have added, we will also ask them for input. That input can be used in future version of the form to be integrated.
### The meaning of "nothing for us, without us"
If you don't live the experience of the target groups you wish to provide for, you risk that you make the wrong assumptions about people's needs. No matter how good the intention, you may end up doing and organizing things that are counterproductive.
## The form - basic technical design
This is meant as a way to make you think of the way you can make your inventory. The way you technically create this, is up to you. During the 2023 CloudFest Hackathon we mainly focussed on creating a page and to describe this form.
### What you need to have before you start
Make sure you have a list at hand of measure you already have in place. You are going to need it while you build your condtional form.
### Form name: Personal Event Configurator
On click, a page appears with this description:
