## Challenge

Introduction: Creating an inclusive environment is a key for planning a successful event. This checklist provides the necessary steps to ensure access for all attendees. While this list demonstrates a handful of situations for disabled people, specific assistance can be provided at the request of the individual. Be sure to gather all the necessary information from attendees prior to the event.



General recommendations on how to overcome or minimize barriers and challenges:

Before events:

Incorporate questions about special needs in the registration form
To create a complete form to identify and understand special requirements
To assign a responsible person to assist people with special requirements
To ensure the availability of the responsible person to help during the event
To ensure having direct contact with a disabled person and communicate their needs
To discuss costs with the financial department
To prepare aids/ tools according to disability {device etc.}
To ensure clear navigation
Add captions or transcripts for audio or video content.
To check if formats and standards are compatible with the different types of devices ( visual readers, browsers, braille readers)
To discuss the possibility of sharing conference materials in advance 
To check for potential obstacles and barriers and adjusting options (availability of elevators, ramps, accessible restrooms, sufficient lightning, signs, etc.)
To provide reserved seating corresponding to the type of disability, accessible transportation, and accomodation
To notify organizers, staff, and speakers about necessary steps, sensitivity, eventually creating a code of conduct and provide it to attendees 
To provide multiple ways for attendees to communicate with event organizers (e.g. email, phone, text, message)
To verify functionality of measurements and tools - user testing 


During events:

Have somebody in the staff that can handle unexpected situations that can occur during the event ( ex : if someone is having difficulties reading the slides, have the possibility to change the seating) 
Ensure all communication channels (e.g. website, social media, flyers) are accessible to people with disabilities (e.g. alt text, captions, braille).

After event:
To request feedback from attendees as a lessons learned and concept for improvement (try this after, maybe “attendees”: to further improve the special service)

Disabilities/ impairment categories {subchapters with recommendations}:

Visual impairment
Proper formatting for assistive technologies {alternative texts for images and videos, heading tags to structure content (text is accessible via keyboard navigation)}
Request to follow rules for creating presentations (high contrast ratio)
Large and legible text, large print or braille
Responsive designs (different screen sizes)
Assistive technology support and compatibility
Taking into consideration seat reservations
User testing

Hearing impairment
Text-based transcript for the audio content and closed captioning
Signs for alerts and notifications
Text-based chat
Language interpreters
User testing

Motor disabilities
Venue accessibility (see general recommendation)
Keyboard accessibility (shortcuts enabled)
Taking into consideration seat reservation
User testing
