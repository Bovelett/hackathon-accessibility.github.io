## Challenge

Creating an inclusive environment is a key for planning a successful event. This checklist provides the necessary steps to ensure access for all attendees. While this list demonstrates a handful of situations for disabled people, specific assistance can be provided at the request of the individual. Be sure to gather all the necessary information from attendees prior to the event.

BEFORE THE EVENT

In this section, the checklist covers general accessibility recommendations for tech events.  


REGISTRATION PROCESS 

_ Incorporate questions about special needs in the registration form
_ Create a complete form to identify and understand someone's special needs 
_ Assign an assistant to help people with special needs  
_ Ensure having direct contact with disabled individuals and communicate with them to satisfy their needs
