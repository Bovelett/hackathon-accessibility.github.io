## Challenge

Creating an inclusive environment is a key for planning a successful event. This checklist provides the necessary steps to ensure access for all attendees. While this list demonstrates a handful of situations for disabled people, specific assistance can be provided at the request of the individual. Be sure to gather all the necessary information from attendees prior to the event.

BEFORE THE EVENT

In this section, the checklist covers general accessibility recommendations for tech events. 

_ Incorporate questions about special needs in the registration form
_ Create a complete form to identify and understand someone's special needs
_ Assign an assistant to help people with special needs 
_ Ensure the availability of assistants to aid during the event
_ Ensure having direct contact with disabled individuals and communicate with them to satisfy their needs
_ Discuss costs with the financial department
_ Prepare aiding tools according to the disability {device etc.}
_ Have a clear navigation plan
_ Adding captions or transcripts for audio or video content.
_ Checking if formats and standards are compatible with the different types of devices ( visual readers, browsers, braille readers)
_ To discuss the possibility of sharing conference materials in advance 
_ Checking for potential obstacles and adjusting options (availability of elevators, ramps, accessible restrooms, sufficient lightning, signs, etc.)
_ To provide reserved seating corresponding to the type of disability, accessible transportation, and accomodation
_ To notify organizers, staff, and speakers about the necessary steps. Applying sensitivity, eventually creating a code of conduct and providing it to attendees 
To provide multiple ways for attendees to communicate with event organizers (e.g. email, phone, text, message)
To verify functionality of measurements and tools - user testing 


During events:

Have somebody in the staff that can handle unexpected situations that can occur during the event ( ex : if someone is having difficulties reading the slides, have the possibility to change the seating) 
Ensure all communication channels (e.g. website, social media, flyers) are accessible to people with disabilities (e.g. alt text, captions, braille).

After event:
To request feedback from attendees as a lessons learned and concept for improvement (try this after, maybe “attendees”: to further improve the special service)

Disabilities/ impairment categories {subchapters with recommendations}:

Visual impairment
Proper formatting for assistive technologies {alternative texts for images and videos, heading tags to structure content (text is accessible via keyboard navigation)}
Request to follow rules for creating presentations (high contrast ratio)
Large and legible text, large print or braille
Responsive designs (different screen sizes)
Assistive technology support and compatibility
Taking into consideration seat reservations
User testing

Hearing impairment
Text-based transcript for the audio content and closed captioning
Signs for alerts and notifications
Text-based chat
Language interpreters
User testing

Motor disabilities
Venue accessibility (see general recommendation)
Keyboard accessibility (shortcuts enabled)
