## Challenge

This handbook is a guide to help bridge the gap between the world of ever advancing technology and people with disabilities. It is the mission of this handbook to provide helpful methods to give accessibility to disabled people in the tech world. 

It is important that despite what you may have heard, you must not assume that all disabled are the same. They’re unique and it is in the best interest to approach their needs accordingly by directly asking them how you could assist them.
